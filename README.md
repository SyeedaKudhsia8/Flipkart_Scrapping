# Filpkart-Scrapping


Surfing different apps like Amazon, Flipkart to buy phone can be tedious task for someone like me. But in today's world; Selenium, Beautiful Soup, Scrapy are the common tools to scrape data from websites in order to convert a difficult task into a simple one.

Using Flask framework and Beautiful Soup library, I have scraped flipkart and dumped my code into the heroku for a user-friendly experience.
