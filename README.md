# Filpkart-Scrapping


Surfing different apps like Amazon, Flipkart to buy the right phone for yourself can be tedious task for someone like me. We usually consider the number of reviews for a particular phone we buy. But nowadays, there are number of tools to scrape data from websites in order to convert a difficult task into a simple one.

Some of them are - 
1. Beautiful Soup
2. Selenium 
3. Scrapy

I have automated a login into the flipkart site to render details of a particular phone with a specific number of reviews.
